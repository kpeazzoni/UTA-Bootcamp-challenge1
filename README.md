# UTA-Bootcamp-challenge1
Challenge 1 from UTA Bootcamp
 
 ## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Final

When inspecting code on Chrome Dev Tools, I made sure that the assessibility rating gave me a check mark and that the page looked clean and was easily readable. In order to accomplish this, I changed the small type font to black so it had better contrast.
